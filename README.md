## Model Selection and Hyper-parameters Tuning

Welcome to the Model Selection and Hyper-parameters Tuning project repository! In this project, we'll explore regression and classification techniques using Python.

### Dataset Overview
The `data_reg.csv` file contains 200 examples with attributes `x1`, `x2`, and continuous target label `y`. Additionally, `train_cls.csv` provides training examples for a binary classification problem.

### Regression Tasks
1. **Data Splitting and Visualization:** Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and visualize them in a 3D scatter plot.
2. **Polynomial Regression:** Apply polynomial regression (degree 1 to 10) and find the best degree by plotting validation error.
3. **Ridge Regression:** Fit a polynomial of degree 8 using ridge regression and select the best regularization parameter.

### Logistic Regression Tasks
1. **Linear Decision Boundary:** Learn a logistic regression model with a linear decision boundary and compute training/testing accuracy.
2. **Quadratic Decision Boundary:** Repeat the above with a quadratic decision boundary.
3. **Overfitting/Underfitting Analysis:** Comment on learned models regarding overfitting/underfitting.
